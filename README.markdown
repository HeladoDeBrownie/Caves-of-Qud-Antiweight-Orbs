Do you want more variety in your selection of gravity-defying spheres? Look no further than this mod, which adds two new kinds: large and powered!

Beware, delver! Large spheres of negative weight are highly unstable and may explode! And beware of the sky, which turns into a deadly drop if you're carrying too much negative weight!

This version of this mod was tested with Caves of Qud version 2.0.201.97 Early Access.
