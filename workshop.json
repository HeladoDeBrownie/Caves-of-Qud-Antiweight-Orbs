{"workshopId":1802640961,"Title":"Antiweight Orbs","Description":"This mod adds two new types of sphere of negative weight — large and powered — and modifies the base-game small sphere of negative weight. All varieties are rare but can be built.\n\nBe careful, delver! The large variety are unstable and may explode! Powered ones, on the other hand, are safe but require a steady supply of energy, and all types will float off if given the chance.\n\nFind source and follow development at: https://bitbucket.org/HeladoDeBrownie/caves-of-qud-antiweight-orbs/","Tags":"item","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
